# Changelog

```log
0.6.2 - 2026/05/01
fix(skills/boot.md): add `.ignore` to gitignore loop — was missing `.ignore` entry that maestro-boot.sh already handles

0.6.1 - 2026/04/30
fix(configure-cli): change all personas from edit/bash deny to ask — write tools hidden when deny matches project root; compound commands (pipes, redirects) now prompt instead of silently failing
feat(boot): add ensureHiddenDirectoriesAreSearchable to maestro-boot-configure-cli.sh — creates .ignore at project root with !.agents/ and !.memory/ entries so AI tooling (glob/grep) can search hidden gitignored directories; ensureGitignoreEntry '.ignore' added to .gitignore

0.6.0 - 2026/04/27

fix(personas/maestro.md): add sub-agent output context to Review loop step, add task-tracking skill reference to Deliver step
fix(personas/architect.md): remove Confidence score section — redundant with DRAFT self-review

0.5.9 - 2026/04/25
