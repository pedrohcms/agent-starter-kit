# Skills

Skills are collected intelligence on how to operate a specific tool — whether that is a CLI, an API, or an MCP/ACP server. They codify procedures, protocols, and output formats that personas reference during execution.

### Available Skills

- `agent-decision` — Structured ambiguity escalation with 1-3-1 analysis and FRAME self-review rubric
- `agent-memory` — Long-term and session memory across sessions
- `architect-self-review` — DRAFT self-review rubric — plan quality gate
- `boot` — Session startup — gitignore, auto-update, memory, rules, orient
- `code-coherence-review` — Logic coherence, correctness, and structural integrity checks
- `code-quality-review` — Rules-walk procedure for coding standards compliance
- `code-sec-review` — OWASP-aligned security code review checklist
- `coder-self-review` — GRASP self-review rubric — implementation quality gate
- `context-maintenance` — How to maintain .context.md files and docs/FEATURE-MAP.md as the project evolves
- `contextualizer-self-review` — TRACE self-review rubric — context generation quality gate
- `dispatch` — Assembles sub-agent prompts with task brief
- `loop-recovery` — Structured recovery and escalation for retry loops
- `reviewer-architect-adversarial` — Adversarial plan validation — structural checks and assumption attack before implementation
- `reviewer-handoff` — Structured review summary format with verdict logic and deterministic coverage scoring
- `review-loop` — LOC-based review tier selection with shapeshifter dispatch for the unified reviewer
- `reviewer-self-review` — SHIELD self-review rubric — unified reviewer quality gate
- `task-tracking` — File-based to-do tracking for multi-step and multi-session work

## When to Extract a Skill

Extract a skill when:

- A tool proves difficult enough that a human must step in and write an explicit how-to for the agent to follow.
- A procedure must be standardized across multiple personas, such as a shared protocol or output format.

Do not extract when the procedure is short and intuitive. If a competent agent can work it out without written guidance, a skill file adds overhead without value.

## File Naming

Lowercase, hyphenated: `task-tracking.md`, `dispatch.md`

Persona-specific skills are prefixed with the persona name: `coder-linting.md`, `reviewer-checklist.md`. Universal skills carry no prefix.

### Frontmatter

- **`shortDescription`** (Required) — What the skill does in one sentence. Example: `Cross-session memory retrieval and storage`
- **`usedBy`** (Required) — Which personas use this skill. `[all]` if injected universally via boot. Example: `[all]` or `[maestro]`
- **`relatedTo`** (Optional) — External tools, CLIs, or APIs this skill wraps or abstracts. Example: `[docker, awk]` or `[anthropic-api]`
- **`version`** (Required) — Semantic version. Example: `0.1.0`
- **`lastUpdated`** (Required) — Last modification date. Example: `2026-02-05`

### Body

- **Purpose** (Required) — What this skill does and why it exists. One paragraph, no bullet points. Answer "what problem does this solve?" not "what steps does it take."
- **Procedure** (Required) — Numbered steps for executing the skill. Each step that produces an artifact must describe its output inline — format, structure, and destination. Reference other skills or rules with `(uses: path)` or `(follows: path)` as needed.
- **Guardrails** (Optional) — Skill-specific pitfalls to avoid. Not commandments, not procedure repetition. Ask: "what mistake would an agent make when using this skill carelessly?"
